            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1⅓ (16 ounce) packages elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>1 pound sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>   
        </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, 
                and stir in the ground beef until crumbly and no longer pink, 
                about 5 minutes. Stir in the onion, garlic, Italian seasoning, 
                cayenne pepper, and salt; continue cooking until the onion has 
                softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes more. 
                Drain off the excess grease, and add the tomato paste and crushed tomatoes. 
                Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack at about 6 inches from the heat source.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes 
                or until al dente; drain. Stir the cooked macaroni into the meat sauce until combined, 
                then spread into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle with Cheddar and Parmesan cheeses.
            </li>
            <li>
                Broil in preheated oven until the cheese is bubbly and golden, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
